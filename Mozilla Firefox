1) Understanding the Developmental Models:
   - Mozilla Firefox is developed using an open-source and community-driven developmental model. This means that it's built by volunteers and professionals from all around the world who collaborate to create a web browser that's fast, secure, and user-friendly. The development process is transparent, and anyone can contribute by writing code, reporting issues, or translating the browser into different languages.

2) Licensing:
   - Mozilla Firefox is released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL), which is an open-source license. This license allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute Firefox freely. It also ensures that the source code remains open for inspection and improvement by the community.

3) Mode of Funding:
   - Mozilla Corporation, a subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation, primarily funds the development of Firefox. Mozilla generates revenue through partnerships with search engines (like Google and Yahoo), which pay for the inclusion of their search engines in Firefox's search bar. Additionally, Mozilla relies on donations and grants from supporters who value the organization's commitment to open-source software and internet privacy.

4) Commercial/Non-Commercial Use:
   - Mozilla Firefox is used by both commercial entities and individual users. Many businesses and organizations use Firefox as their web browser of choice. It's also popular among non-commercial users who appreciate its focus on privacy, security, and customization options. Firefox is available for free, making it accessible to a wide range of users, whether they are using it at work or for personal browsing.
